# gae-gcs-servlet
PhraseOmatic based on the HeadFirst Java example Servlet (originally named "KathyServlet"). 
I have made it better so that the word phrase lists are hosted in Google cloud buckets
and also sprinked on a bit of HTML styling. 
I continue tweaking the words and the presentation as I learn me Java for much joy and gain.
